SN is listed as an ultimate destination for street fashion at cheap rates. There has been a wide range of high-street merchandise available, be it fashion designers, starlets, college students, school going kids, hard working professionals etc. The buyers here are not affected by the weather conditions. Even in summers, when the sun seems especially strong, all the streets of the market are bustling and being elbowed.

All regular shoppers had some advice that sprung from years of experience:

1. To begin with, you must withdraw enough money before entering the market as the ATMs have long queues. 
2. You must remember to carry a king sized bag to stow your shopping, as carrying small polythene bags will not be handy enough and it might become a task to carry so many bags.
3. You must have the quality to bargain and never ask for price. You call out the price you want to pay and walk away if the seller does not agree to your price. Nine out of ten times the vendor will follow you and will give you the thing at your price.
