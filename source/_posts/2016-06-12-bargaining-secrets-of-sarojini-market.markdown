Bargaining has never been my strongest suit. Yes, I’m a girl and I’m openingly admitting that I get cheated more often than not on most of my shopping trips. So if you face the same damn problem, then this video can become your ultimate guide when you’re heading to Sarojini or Linking Road!

[The Teen Trolls](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL2cXKFc76h6EtNXg-KiN3Q) interviewed people on the streets of Sarojini market and asked them for bargaining hacks. Most of them had this one trick, where they walk away from the shop, which I’m totally going to try on my next shopping binge. But the creeper man in the video is the best thing that I saw today. I’m in love for sure.
