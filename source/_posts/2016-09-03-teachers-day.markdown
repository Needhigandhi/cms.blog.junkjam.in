During our school days we had so many friends that we had to cut short the names of who to call on our birthdays and family 
functions but when we grow up, after college and come into the corporate world, people get busy in their respective lives. 
There are just a few friends left who remain close to our heart but our educators, our teachers are the ones who have thousands of people who remember them for ages.

<!-- more -->

Teachers moud us into respectable human beings and give us such life lessons that help us in our lives. 
Isn’t it our moral duty to remember our teachers on their special day and make them feel special? 
Teachers are the inspirational figures who give us the courage to constantly keep moving. 
However, take out time from your corporate lives and make them feel special this teacher’s day.

# Token of appreciation

Teachers deserve appreciation as they remember thousands of names, they know what we are best at and our weakness as well. 
Take out time and order a gift of gratitude for them like a basket full of their favorite things (if at all, you remember what they like), you can also draw and make a special card for them or a scrapbook (if you have images with your teacher). 
This gesture of appreciation will make the teachers feel it down their spine and will be a wonderful sign of gratification.

#Think creatively

This is the era where people are not able to spare time for their families, they are so busy and engrossed in the daily chores that maintaining relations becomes a complicated task.
You don’t have to go out of the way but you can simply make your teachers feel special by making a creative picture and sending it on their Facebook with a heartwarming wish or a heartfelt message for them, make it certain that your teachers acknowledge the message and wishes.

#Celebrate together

Teachers are more than just our mentors, they are our role models. And if we can surprise them by going out of the way to meet them, nothing like it. Celebrate their special day and make them feel that they are important for you.
These are small-small things that make a huge difference.

We might consider these things as trivial but for our teachers, it makes a huge difference for them when their pass-out students remember them and make them feel on the seventh heaven. This is just an act of reverence to make them feel wanted and upright. If you think about the school and college days; don’t you remember how your teachers molded into what you are today? 
How they took pains to help you in growing up? On this teacher’s day, make them feel special and watch a beam appear across their faces.
